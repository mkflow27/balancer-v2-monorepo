# 2023-04-03 - Voting Escrow Remapper

Deployment of the `VotingEscrowRemapper` contract, which allows delegating veBAL balances in mainnet to a different address in L2s and sidechains.
This feature is useful for contract accounts with veBAL in mainnet, since the same address might not be accessible in other networks.

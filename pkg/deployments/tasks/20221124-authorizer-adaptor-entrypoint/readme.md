# 2022-11-24 - Authorizer Adaptor Entrypoint

Deployment of the `AuthorizerAdaptorEntrypoint`, a gateway contract created to address a critical bug found in the `AuthorizerAdaptor` that could lead to unintended escalation of privileges. This contract ensures correct interactions with the adaptor and the system of permissions behind it by working in combination with `TimelockAuthorizer` so that all Adaptor calls made through the Entrypoint check for permissions correctly, while any not made via the Entrypoint fail.
